<h1><center>PHOTOGRAPHY SECTION</center></h1>

<p id="text">Forensic photography, also referred to as crime scene photography, is an activity that records the 
 initial appearance of the crime scene and physical evidence, in order to provide a permanent record 
 for the courts. Crime scene photography differs from other variations of photography because crime
  scene photographers usually have a very specific purpose for capturing each image.<br>

Crime scenes can be major sources of physical evidence that is used to associate or link suspects 
to scenes, victims to scenes, and suspects to victims. This is Locard's exchange principle. It is the
 basic tenet of why crime scenes should be investigated. Anything found at a crime scene can be 
 physical evidence. In scientific crime scene investigation, the first activities at the crime scene 
 are essential for the successful preservation of the physical evidence. The first responder and
  ultimately the crime scene investigator have the obligation to make the scene secure and ensure that
 any further activities at the scene do not change the evidence. The use of a multilevel security
  method would accomplish this task. The preliminary scene survey is the first on-scene activity.
  Precautions are taken for transient and conditional evidence during the survey.<br>
     

All forensic photography must consider three elements at a crime scene: the subject, the scale, and a 
reference object. Also, the overall forensic photographs must be shown a neutral and accurate
 representation.<br><Br>
