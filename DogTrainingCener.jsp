<h1>DOG TRAINING CENTER</h1>

<p>Dog training is the application of behavior analysis which uses the environmental events of
 antecedents and consequences to modify the dog behavior, either for it to assist in specific 
 activities or undertake particular tasks, or for it to participate effectively in contemporary 
 domestic life. While training dogs for specific roles dates back to Roman times at least, the 
 training of dogs to be compatible household pets developed with suburbanization in the 1950s.<br>

A dog learns from interactions it has with its environment. This can be through classical conditioning,
 where it forms an association between two stimuli; non-associative learning, where its behavior is
  modified through habituation or sensitisation; and operant conditioning, where it forms an 
  association between an antecedent and its consequence.</p>
