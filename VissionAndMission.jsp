	<h1>Vission & Mission</h1>
Corruption is ubiquitous and unlimited. It has became all pervading, a world phenomenon.
 It has increased by leaps and bounds worldwide, in direct relation and proportion to our moral 
 degradation, destruction of character, devaluation of human values and lust for power and money.<br><br>

It is said that when character is lost everything is lost. There is no character and so we have lost 
all. The political leaders, the heads of governments and others at helm of the affairs of many
 nations are corrupt and corruption is contagious. It spreads rapidly and percolates to all the lower
  levels. There is no country immune from it. There might be a difference of degrees, but as far as 
  its quality, gravity and pervasiveness are concerned, there is hardly any difference.<br><br>

Corruption in India is rampant and well established in all spheres of our life, public life,
 politics, administration, business, judicial system, education, research and security. There is 
 hardly any exception. There are scandals and scams in plenty, In foreign countries, when corruption
  charges are proved there is suitable punishment, but in India there is no system, no tradition to
   bring the corrupt to trial and then to make him pay for his crime. There is crime but no 
   punishment. It is a salient feature of Indian corruption.<br><br>

Long before our economic globalisation began, India was globalised in respect of political 
corruption and politician- organised crime nexus. Therefore, smugglers, narcotic, barons, 
vice syndicates and protection rackets have become patrons of political parties. The former
 provides large resources to politicians and the latter ensures no legal enforcement against organised
  crime.<br><br>

There is a parallel economy in operation in India and black money is ever on the increase because
 of political patronage and collusion. There is a widespread evasion of taxes, to the tune of crores 
 of rupees every year, owing to corruption in politics, administration and enforcement agencies. In 
 return, the political gurus get huge funds to fight elections and bribes for personal accumulations.
  This helps them to keep themselves in positions of power and influence. The funding from organised 
  black marketers, drug traffickers, underworld dons, mafias and smugglers is actually on a much 
  larger scale than is apparent. This has crippled our economy and turned our planning haywire.<br><br>

So friends join with us and we all fight against crime and corruption to make neat and clean 
environment.<br><br><br>

Jai Hind.
