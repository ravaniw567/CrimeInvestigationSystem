<h2>Collecting Criminal Evidence</h2>
The role of computer forensics in crime has advanced to evidentiary admission in a court of 
law. This is very important in how the evidence is maintained and collected and it has become 
quite a precise process in law enforcement. Demand is high for expertise in computer forensics.<br>

The FBI uses IT professionals to gain serious evidence in their investigations and these crimes
 can be simple or hacking, espionage and even bank fraud. The FBI now uses computer forensics as
  a standard tool to investigate a crime. Using devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and 
  hard drives to collect the evidence needed to prove premeditation in some cases.<br>

Computer forensics is the new frontier of criminal investigation for these agencies and it 
is growing daily. As technology enhances so do the crimes associated with using technology in 
criminal activity.<br>

Computer forensics is widely known for catching criminals in various types of fraud. However,
 investigators are now using computer forensics to catch murderers, and access encrypted data
  daily that will stand as evidence in a court of law.<br>

<h2>Computer Forensics Tools and Tasking</h2>
Those who decide to enter this vocation are considered investigators. 
They will investigate encrypted files and using the LIVE BOX method along with many other 
great new types of software used in the latest techniques available. Information technology 
professionals who choose this profession are considered in a class by themselves.<br>

Many of the tasks included in this particular part of the criminal investigation are recovering 
deleted files, deleted passwords and checking for breaches of security for cyber-crime.
 Once the evidence is collected it must be contained and translated for lawyers, judges,
  and juries to examine.<br>

While one might think that recovering fraud data is the main task of computer forensics this 
is just simply not true anymore. The origin of computer forensics began this way as most of 
the cases solved in the beginning were of this type. However, The BTK Killer was also caught
 and evidence was used in his court trial from computer forensics discovered in a search of 
 his home.<br>

Computer forensics goes back as far as floppy discs? Yes it certainly does and now police use
 their computers for everything from searches to warrants and as technology grows so will the
  ways criminals hide their activities. There does not seem to be a ceiling on technology and 
  the ways it is investigated.<br>

<h2>Cold Case Files Solved Using Computer Forensics</h2>
Law Enforcement agencies are also using computer forensics to reopen and solve cold case files.
 This is a great advantage as technology grows so do the ways to collect information from old
  hard drives to solve crimes that have gone unsolved for years.<br>

The role of computer forensics in crime is increasing as databases are being introduced to hold 
case files for law enforcement. The simple gathering and organization of old forensics from 
unsolved cases have brought forward details that investigators might have missed in initial 
investigations. These innovations are helping to change the face of the criminal investigation.<br>

<h2>The Role of Computer Forensics in Crime</h2>
The role of computer forensics in crime is just going to increase in demand because the need for
 assistance in retrieving information that can be used as evidence is getting more difficult for
  law enforcement. Now more than ever this growing field of study demands IT professionals who
   are experts at this type of data retrieval for law enforcement.<br>

The number one profession for 2015 according to Forbes Magazine is IT professionals and this
 is just for general types of IT positions. IT expertise in law enforcement is not only a 
 critical position but also one that changes the face of law enforcement with technique and 
 expertise to solve cases and make a real difference.<br><br>


<h1>Cyber Forensic Labs in India</h1>
<h3><p>There are seven central forensic laboratories in India, at Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh, New Delhi, Guwahati, Bhopal and Pune.<br>

<b>CFSL Hyderabad</b> is a centre of excellence in chemical sciences.<br>
<b> CFSL Kolkata</b>(the oldest laboratory in India) in biological sciences and<br>
<b> CFSL Chandigarh</b> in physical sciences. <br>
The<b> CFSL New Delhi</b> comes under the Central Bureau of Investigation, Delhi, 
whereas the other laboratories are under the control of the Directorate of Forensic Science
 Services (DFSS) of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The laboratory in New Delhi is under the
  control of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and investigates cases on its behalf. 
  Dr. Nilendu Bikash Bardhan is currently Director of CFSL (CBI) New Delhi. Sh. Badonia is 
  Director of CFSL Kolkata, Sh KM Varshney is Director of CFSL Hyderabad and Dr. S.K. Jain is 
  in charge of CFSL Chandigarh.
 The most important point is it is used for finding forged documents also in this lab.</p>
