"FACES CAN LIE BUT FINGER PRINTS NEVER"</center>

<h2>Origin of Fingerprint Science</h2>
The idea that fingerprints could be used as a means of personal identification was first put 
forward by Sir William Herschel, District Magistrate of Hooghly District, of Bengal province in
 1858. Later, Dr. Henry Faulds gave the idea of tracing a criminal from the latent prints found 
 at the scene of crime and came to the conclusion that no two fingerprints are alike. Based on 
 the idea of Herschel and Faulds, Sir Francis Galton, the renowned English Scientist established
  scientifically the basic principles of uniqueness and permanency in Finger Prints. It was
   then that Sir Edward Richard Henry, the Inspector General of Police, Lower Bengal with the 
   able assistance of two Indian officers namely, Khan Bahadur Azizul Haque and Rai Bahadur 
   Hemchandra Bose, developed a system of classification of fingerprints, thereby discarding 
   the anthropometric system of identification. The first ever Finger Print Bureau in the world
    was established at Writer's Building at Calcutta (now Kolkata) in the year 1897.<br>


<h2>What is FingerPrint Recognition</h2>
Fingerprint recognition refers to the automated method of identifying or confirming the identity of an individual based 
on the comparisson of two fingerprints. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most well known
 biometrics, and it is by far the most used biometric solution for authentication on 
 computerized systems. The reasons for fingerprint recognition being so popular are the ease of
 acquisition, established use and acceptance when compared to other biometrics, 
and the fact that there are numerous (ten) sources of this biometric on each individual.<br><br>


<h2>FINGERPRINT PATTERNS<br>
BASIC PATTERNS<br></h2>
The three basic patterns of fingerprint ridges are the arch, the loop, and the whorl. 
An arch is a pattern where the ridge enters one side of the finger, then rises in the center
 forming an arch, and exits on the other side of the finger. With a loop the ridge enters one 
 side of the finger, then forms a curve, and exits on the same side of the finger from which it
  entered. Loops are the most common pattern in fingerprints. Finally a whorl is the pattern you
   have when ridges form circularly around a central point.<br><br>
