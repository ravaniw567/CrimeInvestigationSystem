Indian law is enforced by a number of agencies. Like many federal nations, the constitution of 
India delegates the maintenance of law and order primarily to the states and territories.

At the federal level, some of India's paramilitary forces are part of the Ministry of Home
 Affairs and support the states. Larger cities have police forces under their respective state 
 police. All senior officers in the state police forces and federal agencies are members of the Indian Police Service (IPS).
